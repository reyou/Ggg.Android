Or, programmatically add the fragment to an existing ViewGroup.
At any time while your activity is running, you can add fragments to your activity layout. You simply need to specify a ViewGroup in which to place the fragment.

To make fragment transactions in your activity (such as add, remove, or replace a fragment), you must use APIs from FragmentTransaction. You can get an instance of FragmentTransaction from your FragmentActivity like this:

KOTLIN
JAVA
val fragmentManager = supportFragmentManager
val fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction()

You can then add a fragment using the add() method, specifying the fragment to add and the view in which to insert it. For example:

KOTLIN
JAVA
val fragment = ExampleFragment()
fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment)
fragmentTransaction.commit()

The first argument passed to add() is the ViewGroup in which the fragment should be placed, specified by resource ID, and the second parameter is the fragment to add.

Once you've made your changes with FragmentTransaction, you must call commit() for the changes to take effect.
